Array is the collection of elements of the same datatype.

How to declare the array:

datatype[] array_name = new datatype[size];

where,
 1. datatype can be any primitive/or non Primitive datatype
 2. array_name is a name given to the array
 3. size is an integer value to represent the no. of elements of array

int[] myarr = new int[10];

as given in above declaration
int is the datatype
myarr is the name of array
10 is the no. of elements of array

Array elements are accessed using its indexes
array index always starts from zero(0)

If there are N elements in the array, then index will be 0 to (N-1)
