Loop?

Loop is a programming construct used for performing repeatative task.

It is a block of code in which the possible repeatative code is written.

Iteration - 
    Iteration means the no of instances the loop is executing its code. 
    eg. If loop executes for 10 times then we say there are 10 iterations.

Theare are two categories of loops - 
    1. Entry Controlled Loop - 
        The loops who have the execution criteria at the begining of the loop.
        If the condition is true then only the loop will executed. Unless and until
        the condition is false.
        a. While Loop
        b. For Loop
        c. Extended For Loop (Array)

    2. Exit Controlled Loop-
        The loops who have the execution cirteria at the end of the loop body.
        If the condition is true then the loop will execute. This loop executes atleast
        once even if the condition is false.
        a. do-while Loop

1. While Loop
---
    while(condition){
        statement 1
        statement 2
        ..
        statement N
    }

2. For loop
---
    for(counter_initialization; condition; counter increment / decrement){
        statement 1
        statement 2
        ..
        statement N
    }
